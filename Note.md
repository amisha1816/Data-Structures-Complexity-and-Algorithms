#### ✏️ Matrix

A representations of numbers, symbols, or expressions in a 2-Dimensional Array. In Computer Science we can start to create a data structure that has values in rows and columns, much like a table, by utilizing a list within a list. There are external libraries/modules that can be imported into replit to help this process as well.

```python
matrix_A = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    {5, 6, 7, 8}
]
```

Rules for Matrix's in python:
- All rows must have the same number of values
- All columns must have the same number of values
- All items in the 2D List must have the same data types
- Since indexing always starts at 0 ... row 1 is technically located at matrix_A[0]

#### ✏️ List Comprehension

Is a concise method to create a list in Python. Commonly used when the list is made from another sequence, a member of another list/sequence or is a result of some operations applied to all it's item.

```python
squares = [i**2 for i in range(10)]
```

How does it work?
- A Square Bracket containing an expression that describes the list
- 1+ ```for clause``` to explain its items
- 0+ ```if clauses``` depending on the complexity of the list (e.g. for blank if x, y, z)

#### ✏️ map()

What does it do - Applys a function to iterable data

``` Format - map(function_name, sequence)```

- function_name: any function (built-in or selfmade) 
- sequence: any iterable data type

```python
square_array = list(map(square, array)
# square is the function, # array is the sequence
```

#### ✏️ filter()
  
What does it do - Filters out items from a data set that meets a certain condion (condition is True)

``` Format: filter(bool_returning_function, sequence)```

- function: The function name we provide for filter() must be return a boolean value ... should also be able handle the items inside the sequence as its arguments
- sequence: any iterable data type

```python

def isOdd(x)
    return x % 2 != 0 # will return either True or False

array = list(range(1, 10)
odds = list(filter(isOdd, array)
# in this case the function would return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

#### ✏️ Tuples

Tuple is a new data type! They're sliceable, indexable and iterable

``` Format: (item, item...) - because of this format tuple comprehension uses round brackets```

Examples:
```python
a = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
d = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 'Hi!')
```

Built in Functions with Tuple
- built in: max, min, len
- special: tuple (e.g ``` tuple(word) - ('H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')```

Packing and Unpacking
Tuple allows us to easily collect variables and assign them to certain values. For instance:

```python

# Packing
var_1 = 2
var_2 = 3
var_3 = 5

prime = var_1, var_2, var_3
output - (2, 3, 5)

# Unpacking
fib = (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)

fib_0, fib_1, fib_n = fib[0], fib[1], fib[2:]
e.g. fib_0 = 0
e.g. fib_n = (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
